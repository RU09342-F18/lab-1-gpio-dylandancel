This is the same code of the Multiple Blink code flashed to the MSP430G2553 for breadboard operation instead of  development board operation. The G2 is powered by
the 3.3V being connected to Vcc and the reset of the G2. Vss is connected to ground. The designated outputs BIT0 and BIT6 are connected to LEDS. BIT0 is
connected to the anode of the red LED and BIT6 is connected to a green LED. Both LEDS are connected to ground by a 5k resistor.
