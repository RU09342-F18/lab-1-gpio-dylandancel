The program makes 2 LEDS blink at the same time. Both bit1 and bit6 are set outputs which allow them to turn on and off. The blinking of the LEDS are controlled
by an incrementer x being modulo'd within an if statement. The value being modulo'd with x determines at which the frequency of the LEDS being on.
