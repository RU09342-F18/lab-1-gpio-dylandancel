This is code to make 2 LEDS blink on the MSP432401R. The BIT0 of pin 1 and BIT 2 of pin 2 must be
set as output such that the LEDS turn on and off. An incrementer with an integer variable x is introduced
to control the rate at which the LEDS blink. These values can be adjusted to achieve faster or slower
speeds.
